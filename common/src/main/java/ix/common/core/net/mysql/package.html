This package provides an interface to communicate with the MySQLDeamon on a server. This can be from any server, to any
server, with the restriction that both servers are added to the .net package ({@link system.core.net}). This package is being
loaded as a {@link system.core.net.Deamon}, and can be accessed as a deamon of a specific {@link system.core.net.Server}. For this one
should first get the {@link system.core.net.ServerService}, second get the Server and third get the {@link system.core.net.mysql.MySQLDeamon}
using the name supplied by this class. With this deamon one can get one of the available {@link system.core.net.mysql.MySQLDatabase}s,
 and start querying it. When anything goes wrong, a {@link system.core.net.sql.SQLException} is thrown.
</p>
<p>
This package consists of a {@link system.core.net.mysql.MySQLDeamon}, which consists of {@link system.core.net.mysql.MySQLDatabase}s,
which are loaded with a {@link system.core.net.mysql.MySQLDeamonData} instance and on error throw a {@link system.core.net.sql.SQLException}
</p>
<p>
Currently the following data implementations are available:
<ul>
	<li>{@link system.core.net.mysql.XMLMySQLDeamonData}
