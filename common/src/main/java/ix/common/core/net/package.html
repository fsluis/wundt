<p>
Provides classes for the access to the different servers used by your project. Gives classes for the servers on which
your project is running, as well as the different deamons it uses on the servers.
</p><p>
The purpose is to centrally supply the information needed for the use of the different resources,
and to restrict access to the login-information of the different deamons to this centralized package.
</p>
<h2>Package structure</h2>
<p>
This package consists of a service {@link system.core.net.ServerService} which uses a {@link system.core.net.NetData}
implementation for the retrieval of it's data, and consists of {@link system.core.net.Server}s and
{@link system.core.net.Driver}s. Each servers consists of several {@link system.core.net.Deamon}s, which handle
the connection to that server using different protocols.
</p>
<h2>Retrieving a deamon</h2>
<p>
A deamon is used to connect to a deamon running on a server, such as MySQL. To use this connection, one must do the
following steps:
<ul>
    <li>Get the {@link system.core.net.ServerService}
    <li>Retrieve the wanted {@link system.core.net.Server} to connect to
    <li>Get the {@link system.core.net.Deamon} to connect with
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Loading the available deamons</h2>
<p>
This package is read-only, and mutations should be directly in the data files. It uses {@link system.core.net.NetData}
implementations to load the data. The path of this should be supplied to the {@link system.core.net.ServerService}
when calling the {@link system.core.net.ServerService#startService(system.util.Configuration)}. Currently the following data
implementation is available for storing which servers/deamons:
<ul>
	<li>{@link system.core.net.XMLNetData}
</ul>
