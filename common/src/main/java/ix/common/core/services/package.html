This package gives the ability to organise your system through a services-design. This means that each subsystem is a
service, which can be requested using a static branch of services, available through the whole system.
</p>
<h2>Package structure</h2>
<p>
The data in this package consists of a {@link system.core.services.ServiceBranch}, which contains other
{@link system.core.services.ServiceBranch}es and {@link system.core.services.ServiceLeaf}s. Each
{@link system.core.services.ServiceLeaf} wraps a {@link system.core.services.Service} instance, and handles the
life cycle of it (starting and stopping). To load and save the services/branches, there is a
{@link system.core.services.ServicesData} class which can be implemented to handle the loading and saving. Finally,
there is a class to provide the one root branch for the whole system, the {@link system.core.services.Services} class.
</p>
<h2>Initialising the package</h2>
<p>
To initialise the package, one needs the {@link system.core.services.Services} class. From this class, one can retrieve
the root {@link system.core.services.ServiceBranch} using the {@link system.core.services.Services#getRoot()} method.
This branch needs to be given a data handling implementation to load the branch with. For more information about the
available implementations, see below. This data handling implementation should be set using the
{@link system.core.services.ServiceBranch#setData(system.core.services.ServicesData)} method. The data handling
implementation will then be requested to load the root branch.
</p>
<h2>Retrieving a service</h2>
<p>
Once the package has been initialised, this is a simple process:
<ul>
    <li>Get the {@link system.core.services.Services}
    <li>Retrieve the root {@link system.core.services.ServiceBranch}, and any subbranches
    <li>Get the service, using the Class of the service, like branch.getService(ServerService.class).
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Data layer</h2>
<p>
The following implementations are available:
<ul>
	<li>{@link system.core.services.XMLServicesData}
	<li>{@link system.core.services.MySQLServicesData}
</ul>
</p>
