<p>
    The XML package provides easy to use XMLTools for parsing and modifying xml files. It is based on the Xerces XML
    package, but converted to a much smaller library with more powerfull functions. You can use {@link
    ix.common.core.xml.Document} to parse xml documents really easy, using the {@link
    ix.common.core.xml.XmlTag} interface. If you need to parse xml tags in a file that has a lot of other tags
    (like an xhtml file) the parsing of such a file would be slow and memory consuming. To search and replace tags in
    xhtml or other large xml files, we recommend the use of the {@link ix.common.core.xml.XmlTextToolkit}
    class, that has a lot of handy functions for finding tags and replacing them.</p>
